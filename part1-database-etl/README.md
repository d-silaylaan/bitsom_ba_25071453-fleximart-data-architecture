Part 1: Database and ETL Overview

In Part 1, raw CSV files containing customers, products, and sales data are loaded into a MySQL database.
A Python ETL pipeline is used to clean, transform, and insert the data into structured tables.
After loading the data, SQL business queries are written to analyze sales performance and customer behavior.
A data quality report is generated to check missing values, duplicates, and data consistency.
