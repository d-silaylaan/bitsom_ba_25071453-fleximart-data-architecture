Project Overview:
This project is about building a data system for a retail company called FlexiMart. Raw customer, product, and sales data is loaded into a database using Python. SQL queries are used to find useful business information.
MongoDB is used to work with NoSQL data. A data warehouse is created to support analytics and reporting.

## Key Learnings

Through this project, I learned how to load raw data into a database using an ETL process. I understood how SQL queries are used to analyze business data and answer real-world questions. I learned how MongoDB works with NoSQL data and how it is different from relational databases. I also learned how a data warehouse is designed using fact and dimension tables. This project helped me understand the complete flow of data from raw files to analytics.


Challenges Faced:
Understanding mysql connections
Designing the data warehouse
loading data to database using ETL pipelines
